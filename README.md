## 📌 Presentation Overview

### 🔹 Section 1: Introduction to AI
- Definition of AI and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
- Real-world AI use cases in public sector and enterprise

### 🔹 Section 2: Understanding Generative AI
- GenAI defined: creation of text, images, music, video using models like GANs and LLMs
- GenAI vs Traditional AI
- Architecture and principles (tokens, temperature, vector embeddings)

### 🔹 Section 3: LLMs & Transformers
- The evolution of LLMs: From Turing to Transformers
- How LLMs process language at scale
- Importance of embeddings and attention mechanisms

### 🔹 Section 4: Practical Mechanics
- How AI models generate content
- Example: Christie's $432,000 AI-generated art
- Tokenization, softmax scoring, temperature control

### 🔹 Section 5: RAG & Fine-Tuning
- Lifecycle of an LLM
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific responses
- Benefits of RAG over full fine-tuning
